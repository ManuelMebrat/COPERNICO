Cop√©rnico is the most ambitious and exciting project I‚Äôve worked on so far ‚Äî an **AI conversational agent** designed to transform how businesses in **marketing, e-commerce, and dropshipping** analyze data and make decisions.  

## üöÄ What is Cop√©rnico?  
Cop√©rnico is more than a chatbot. It‚Äôs an intelligent data companion that:  
- Connects with multiple platforms (Meta Ads, client, supplier systems, and CRMs like Salesforce).  
- Analyzes **large datasets** in real time using **SQL, Python, and ETL pipelines**.  
- Builds dynamic insights and dashboards (Power BI) to track sales, inventory, and campaign performance.  
- Provides actionable recommendations through natural conversation, helping non-technical users understand data instantly.  

## üõ†Ô∏è My Role & Contributions  
As **Project Owner** of Cop√©rnico, I was in charge of shaping the product from concept to execution. My responsibilities included:  
- Leading the **design and product thinking**, ensuring every feature aligned with business needs.  
- Acting as the bridge between **clients and the development team**, translating business requirements into technical tasks.  
- Working **head-to-head with data scientists and machine learning engineers** to build models and integrate AI capabilities.  
- Overseeing **QA testing** to guarantee accuracy, reliability, and usability across the platform.  
- Simulating **realistic datasets** using the Python library **Faker**, which allowed me to test, validate, and analyze business scenarios with near real-world conditions.  
- Guiding the development roadmap to ensure the solution delivered both **technical performance** and **business impact**.  

## üí° Why Cop√©rnico Matters  
This project represents the perfect blend of my professional background:  
- From my work as a **Data Strategist at Clazz Digital**, where I led the MVP  AI-powered agent, I learned how to align data and AI with real business goals.  
- From my roles as a **Business Analyst** , I brought expertise in data integration, ERP (SAP, Salesforce).  
- From my technical skills in SQL, PostgreSQL, Python, Power BI, and ETL, I collaborated with the team to build the backbone that makes Cop√©rnico reliable and scalable

## üåç Vision  
Cop√©rnico is built for scale: to serve thousands of users, simplify complex analytics, and bridge the gap between **raw data** and **business intelligence**. It‚Äôs not just my biggest project ‚Äî it‚Äôs the foundation of my vision for how AI can **democratize data-driven decision making** in e-commerce.
